# Fishing-Event-Assistant
2019 Summer Project aiming to provide an offline web application for the Bintulu Mariner Club to facilitate fishing competitions.
# Functions
Add, remove participants for the event.
Add, remove catchs for the participants.
Sorting functions base on the weight of the catch to determine the winners.
Search functions to select participants base on name or ID.
# Technicals
This offline web application is built with HTML,PHP and JavaScript while using MySQL as the back-end database.
Most of the operations are done using XML request minimizing the need to change the web-page.
# Terms of use
While this web application is built for the Bintulu Mariner Club, any personnel or organizer is free to use this for non-profit purpose, do give me feedbacks and I will try to improve the application as much as I could.
